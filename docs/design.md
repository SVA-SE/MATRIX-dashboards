Design refers here to the substantial process of both content planning and visual design. Readers of this manual who are familiar with the data that will populate the dashboard, will most likely be more concerned and more skilled in the content planning phase. For the sake of completeness, this chapter will cover some principles of visual design and some considerations regarding dashboard design specifically. However, for complex projects, and especially for public-facing dashboard, it is highly recommended to enlist the help of a web designer, for example from the Communication Department of your institute.



# Content Planning

The content planning phase is crucial to create a good product that will fulfill its purpose and properly meet the needs of the user. Going through this phase meticulously will give clarity for the upcoming development, allow scalability and flexibility, and save time and resources in the long run.

The steps involved in this phase are to (1) define in detail what your product will be, (2) identify the profile of the intended user(s) and (3) design the content flow of your dashboard.


## Know your product

Content planning begins with clearly identifying the nature, aim, scope and limitations of your product. 

_TODO: list helpful questions for product definitions_


## Know your users

Identifying the problems, needs and expectations of the users is the key to building a successful and useful product. It would be unwise to develop the exact same dashboard for a small set of experts and for the general public. Likewise, you, as a scientist and dashboard developer, have a different level of knowledge and familiarity with the content of the dashboard than the intended user. Doing detailed user profiling will help to craft a platform fully targeted to the needs of the users.

## Layout design

With the insight gained from product definition and user profiling, it is now possible to start organising content in a meaningful way.


### Global Page Layout

In this step, you decide which basic website elements (logo, menu, footer, ...) will be present, and where to display them on the page. This will be in parts dependent on the technical solution you have chosen to develop the dashboard, and how much flexibility it allows.

In general, don't get too creative. Most people are familiar with the internet and have a set of expectations when it comes to navigating a website. Deviating from these expectations will only make your dashboard harder to use.

Here are were basics web elements are expected to be found:

- Logo and website name: Top of the page. Centered or in the left corner
- Main navigation menu: Top of the page. Below or to the right of the logo. Alternatively in a sidebar to the left of the page.
- Main content: Occupies most of the screen. Traditionaly will be linear content on a scrollable long page, with fixed width and centered on the screen. Alternatively, dashboards can be presented as tiled blocks of content on a grid that takes the whole screen.
- Footer: Optional but very useful. A band occupying the whole bottom section of a page. Usually contains:
  - logo and name of the page
  - copyright with date of activity and name of the developer/page owner/institute
  - main navigation links
  - contact information
  - (optional) legal information, logos and links to partner institutions, links to employees only sections, ...


### Content Structure

In this step you start deciding on the content (text, maps, graphs, interactive input fields, downloadable elements, â€¦) that your dashboard will contain, and how to structure this content. The user research done previously should greatly inform the decisions you take here.

The goal is to divide and organise the information in meaningful blocks and create a natural flow of content that guides the user to the information they need. Based on the product definition and the overview of your users' needs, you can decide which content is needed, how to structure it and in which order it should be introduced.

_For example, in the Norwegian One Health dashboard for the surveillance of Campylobacter, we have divided the website in several tabs and subtabs based on what the users will come to the website for. The landing page (Oneh Health > Campylobacter surveillance) shows at a glance the most important information, relevant to all users. More detailed information is put aside in other tabs, where the user can find them if and when they need it.
- _One Health
  - _Campylobacter surveillance: model results, interactive outbreak risk maps and combined multi-sectorial data
  - _About Campylobacter: detailed info on Campylobacter and its impact on humans, animals and its relationship to the environment
  - _One Health: information on the One Health approach and the relevant OHEJPs
  - _Contact: contact info of various actors of the project
- _Animal Health: raw data from the animal side
- _Public Health: raw data from the human side_


Start designing at a global level and dive into details iteratively. Will you have tabs and subtabs? What graphs or visualisations will you have? Are they interactive? What text is needed to accompany the data?
